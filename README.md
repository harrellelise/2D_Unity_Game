# 2D_Unity_Game
This is the video game I created for my Independent Study in my Senior Year at Simmons University. I worked in Unity with C# to create a 2d platformer game. My goal was to learn the basics of video game programming, as well as learning about game design by reading 'Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals' by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.

## Using the Repo
Inside the Game_Runnable file is everything needed to run my 2D game. Simply download all the files in the folder, and to run open the Independent_Study.exe file. The game will launch from there.

Inside the Project Scripts are all the C# code files that I used to build the game. Feel free to take a look at them. It shows how I controlled all player movement, buttons, enemy movement, dying, the main menu, character selection, and more. 

## Premise of the Project
The idea of my Independent Study was to get a better idea of what goes into creating a video game. I had worked in C# and unity in my minesweeper project which can be found here: https://github.com/harrellelise/Csharp_PLP 
I really enjoyed working on this and wanted to try working on my own 2D platformer, as I play a good amount of those. The idea was to create a finished game, focusing on game play, music, menus, and different enemy and obstacle implementations versus creating a lot of levels. I wanted to get an idea of the work that went into all the aspects of creating a game. 

Through reading Rules of Play, I got a good idea of what goes into creating a video game, and focused not on the animations or sprites first, but on creating a fun game, doing lot of user testing to get an idea of what people liked from player movement, and working out bugs before I started creating more levels and adding in animations and more obstacles. I learned the most important part of creating a game is focusing first on getting something fun to play, and having a good premise, before diving into the story and details. Because of this, there is no story to my game, but rather is something that would be added in the future if I were to come back and work more on this game.

That being said there are some other things that I was not able to get into, but would like to finish implementing in the future.

What I worked on:
- walking/jumping w/ animations
- buttons/button animation
- death w/animation
- obstacles/enemies
- interactable objects (Boxes)
- start menu
- character selection
- music/effect implementation
- music/effects volume selection
- instructions
- game shortcuts

What I want to add:
- more levels
- save game progress
- story
- backgrounds/art
