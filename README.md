# 2D_Unity_Game
This is the video game I created for my Independent Study in my Senior Year at Simmons University. I worked in Unity with C# to create a 2d platformer game. My goal was to learn the basics of video game programming, as well as learning about game design by reading 'Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals' by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.
